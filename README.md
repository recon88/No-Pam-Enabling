# Don't Enable Pam
*Changes the "Pam Is Thirsty" story quest to require juice instead of pale ale. You can avoid being an enabler for Pam's alcohol habits.*

## Features
I always try to avoid giving alcohol to Shane or Pam... even though they love it. But for the "Pam Is Thirsty" quest received by mail on Summer 14 in Y1, you have to deliver a pale ale. I wrote this mod to change that.

**Don't Enable Pam** mod replaces the "Pam Is Thirsty" quest objective to have you deliver juice! It also modifies the quest description, mail, and dialogue with new flavor text to reflect this change.

### DETAILS

Pam will still mention pale ale, but says that Penny is trying to get her to drink more juice instead. Pam asks the farmer to bring her some; the quest will be completed with the usual rewards when you deliver the juice to Pam (any type).

> NOTE: if it's hard to imagine Pam asking for juice, there is an alternate version: Penny can send you the quest mail instead, asking you to deliver some juice to her mom. You can choose which version to use in this mod's config settings.

**This mod works on all new and existing saves**, even if you've already received the original quest, deleted the original quest, or completed it! If you already received the original quest version at some point, this mod will replace it by delivering a new quest letter to your mailbox. Opening the mail will add the updated version to your quest log.

If you haven't yet opened your original quest letter, this mod will change its contents to give you the new quest version from the start.
